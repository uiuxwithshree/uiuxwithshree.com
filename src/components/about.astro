        Empowering the world with functional designs.
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Hey, I'm Shree (pronounced as /ʃri:/ — with /ʃ/ like *sh* in “sharp”, /r/
        as in “red”, and /i:/ like the *ee* in “tree”). I design interfaces that
        don't just look good—they work. Clean, intuitive, user-focused. That's
        the standard I hold every pixel to.
        <br /><br />
        My journey into design started in college, driven by an obsession with how
        digital products looked and felt. I began redesigning my favorite apps just
        for fun—until I realized it was more than a hobby. That curiosity turned
        into a purpose. I dove into design principles, took on freelance gigs, and
        collaborated on real-world projects to sharpen my skills.
        <br /><br />
        Today, I turn rough ideas into refined, user-friendly products. I believe
        good design solves problems; great design anticipates them. My goal is simple:
        understand the user, remove the unnecessary, and make every interaction feel
        effortless.
        <br /><br />
        When I'm not designing, I'm learning how people think, exploring meaningful
        trends, and sketching ideas that may just belong in your next project. I
        don't wait for the “perfect moment.” If something matters, I believe in starting
        now—and doing it right.

        Milestones — How It Really Went Down
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        My design journey wasn't some perfect blueprint. It was a series of
        missteps, breakthroughs, and learning the hard way. I didn't wake up as
        a UI/UX designer—I became one by trying, failing, and trying again.
        <br /><br />
        From taking on my first unpaid design project to delivering high-impact UI
        for real clients, every milestone taught me something the internet couldn't.
        I've built wireframes that got scrapped, prototypes that turned into products,
        and designs that helped startups grow.
        <br /><br />
        Every step—whether chaotic or clear—built the designer I am today. And honestly,
        I'm just getting started.
